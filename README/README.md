# Project Name: PlanWise

A project of software engineer, making a schedule based on email scraping

## Project Description

This project is an efficient tool specifically designed to automatically capture dates and schedule them. 

It uses Django as a backend Server based on Python, and use HTML, CSS and JS as frontend interface.

It will allow users to associate with their **Outlook Email or Gmail**, and set or edit their account information. 

Once the date is captured, it is automatically added to the user's schedule. User can also add or edit schedule by themselves individually.

## Project Struction

Here is the key function of application within project:

- `planWise/settings.py`: Configures settings for the Django project, including installed apps, database, etc.
- `mailhandler/emailprocessing/base.py`: Implemented user authentication and the reading of the user's email.
- `mailhandler/views.py`: Enables email analysis and database import, as well as back-end and front-end contact and model mapping.
- `mailhandler/forms.py`: To generate an HTML form that allows users to submit event information, including date and time, address, event details, and comments.
- `user/forms.py`:Create some forms for the CustomUser model that are related to Django user management, including creating and modifying users, and provide custom representations for some fields.
- `user/views.py`: Implemented a user sign-up view using a custom form that redirects to a login page after a user has successfully signed up.
- `catch_date/views.py`: Create a event management function that users can use to create, browse, update, delete and view their event details, and in the event list, events can be sorted by time and display a countdown for each event.

## Getting Start

### Installation

```bash
# navigate to your project
cd your/path/to/PlanWise

After that you can type http://localhost:8000/check-users/ on your web browser to see tha application interface.

## Features of Software

- **Automation**: The tool can automatically capture schedule information and schedule it into the user's schedule. 
- **Support for multiple email services**: Allows users to link their Outlook or Gmail accounts.
- **Personalized schedule management**: Users can set or edit personal information, and add and edit schedules automatically or manually.

- Python version >= 3.10
- Installed Django on your global.

## Purpose of the software

### Type of Software Development Process

- This porject uses the [**Waterfall model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) process.

### Why Chose Waterfall

The decision was based on several key factors:

- **Well-defined Requirements**: The project has well-defined requirements from the outset, with little expected change. The Waterfall model's sequential approach allows for thorough planning and execution in such scenarios.
- **Project Complexity**: Given the complexity and scale of the project, the Waterfall model provides a systematic approach. Each phase has specific deliverables.
- **Easy to understand and implement**: The waterfall model is structured in a intuitive way, and easy to understand, especially for novices or teams of students. It provides a clear guidance framework to help team members understand their roles and responsibilities in the project.
- **Risk Management**: Although Agile is known for early risk identification, the project's scope and scale mean that upfront planning can effectively mitigate most risks.

Choosing Waterfall supports our need for strict project management, and dealing with complex, large-scale projects.

### Possible usage of Software (Target Market)

The software is primarily intended for groups that need to effectively manage, consolidate, and access events or meetings received via email, including but not limited to:

- **Business Professionals**: The software automates the email schedule management process, helping these busy professionals save time and avoid missing any important events.
- **Educational institutions**: Educators alike need to properly manage and outline their schedules, and our software can reduce the complexity and time consuming of handling these tasks.

## Software development plan

### Development Process

- **Project Management and Collaboration**: Tasks are managed with GitHub issues. We discuss problems, propose solutions within GitHub, ensuring all team members can easily follow the project's progress and participate in discussions. 
- **Workflow and Timeline**: Our project is divided into several phases. Each phase corresponds to a particular set of features for the application.
 
### Members

- **Lawrrence**: Mainly responsible for the construction of the framework, the construction of the basic project structure, the construction and beautification of front-end web pages, and the repair and testing of some bugs.

- **Chieri**: Responsible for implementing the logic to access user emails through two-factor authentication, managing the retrieval and database integration processes, and displaying the information on the frontend. This includes using JavaScript to enable real-time updates of emails on the frontend and their simultaneous storage in the backend database. Additionally, I am tasked with developing a ChatGPT AI interface for analyzing the content of the emails. The results of this analysis are automatically used to generate forms that users can decide whether to add to their schedules. I am also in charge of creating a schedule interface that sorts entries by ID and deadline.

- **Keith**: Mainly responsible for fixing some bugs and changing the content of HTML.

- **Oscar**ï¼šResponsible for writing a application which allows user to operate their events.

### Schedule

### Algorithm

Our overall project uses an algorithm of cumulative iterations.

This is a example code from one of the applications.

```python
# mailhandler/emailProcessing/base.py
def analyze_email_content(email_content):
    url = "http://154.44.10.169:1145/analyze_email"
    data = {"email_content": email_content}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print("Failed to get a successful response from the API. Status Code:", response.status_code)
        return None
```
Evolve according to the evolution of project needs. Initially, it may be as simple as extracting some basic information, and later more complex text analysis and processing logic may be added to extract more valuable data.

### Current status of the software

- **Version**: PlanWise 2.0 which has fixed bugs and improve functionality.
- **Implemented Features**: Automatically capture emails and allow users to independently modify schedules, with a countdown designed for the end of the schedule.

### Future plan

We will continue to improve the user experience of our software to make it more relevant to the diverse needs of work. We plan to develop a more intuitive interface and add more features for schedule management, such as prioritization, tagging, etc. We also welcome feedback and suggestions from users to work together to take this project to the next high level.
